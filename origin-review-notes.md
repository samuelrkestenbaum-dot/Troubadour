- "somewhat rote" (honest without being cruel)
- "never quite commits to either aesthetic" (identifying half-measures)
- "the album's most sophisticated achievement" (earned praise)
- "genuinely transcendent" (high praise reserved for best moments)
- "demographic specificity" (identifying audience limitations)

## The Core Insight for Troubadour
The review was strong but limited because Claude couldn't HEAR the music.
Troubadour solves this: Gemini actually listens to the audio, then Claude writes the critique grounded in what was heard.
The F# pivot, the vocal performance, the modulation — these are things only audio analysis can capture.
