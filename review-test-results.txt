The review includes:
- Section-by-section notes with timestamps (Intro, Verse 1, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, etc.)
- Specific actionable feedback per section
- Genre comparisons (Coldplay, U2)
- Production notes
- Arrangement suggestions

Issues to fix:
1. Quick Take text is truncated (ends with "this fr") - need to show full text
2. The review markdown starts with the same text as Quick Take - might look redundant
3. "Ask About This Review" button visible - the chat sidebar integration works
